## BERT Skolkovo [notebook](https://github.com/levppp/Toxic-comments-classification-in-Russian-with-BERT-and-Catboost/blob/main/Skolkovo_toxic_model.ipynb)

## Catboost [notebook](https://github.com/levppp/Toxic-comments-classification-in-Russian-with-BERT-and-Catboost/blob/main/Catboost%20toxic%20model.ipynb)
Catboost seems to be working better on the real-world data. Even though Skolkovo model has shown 97% accuracy.
